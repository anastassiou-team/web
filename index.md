## Anastassiou lab at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center

The Anastassiou Laboratory studies how the molecular and cellular composition of neurons translates to their phenotype and how these properties combine in brain circuits to produce function or, in the case of disease, dysfunction.

The Anastassiou Lab has a broad background in multimodal cellular data (electrophysiology, anatomy, transcriptomics) and the development of state-of-the-art computational workflows (statistical learning, optimization and simulation) to understand cellular activity in behavior and disease. Uniquely, this work includes human brain tissue, both as a byproduct from surgery as well as from model systems such as human pluripotent stem cells. The Anastassiou Lab successfully pursues collaborations with clinicians to translate cellular and circuit findings to gain a better understanding of diseases such as epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease, as well as development of improved therapies.

The Anastassiou lab is affiliated with the [Cedars-Sinai Neurosurgery Department](https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/research/departments-institutes/neurosurgery.html), [Neurology Department](https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/research/departments-institutes/neurology.html), [Center of Neural Sciences and Medicine](https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/research/areas/neural-science.html) and the [Regenerative Medicine Institute](https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/research/departments-institutes/regenerative-medicine.html).
